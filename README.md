# Tosho

Modern, minimalist design, cross-platform file manager with a focus on ebook organizing.

Tosho aims to solve the void of cross-platform ebook readers that can handle all popular book file types (epub, pdf, markdown, comic archive formats) while also not having the UI of an ancient dinosaur (sorry calibre).
